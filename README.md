# PythonResearchAssignment
A assignment in Python programming exploring the capabilities of the language and its libraries

## Runner
```
python3 main.py
```

## Results 
This should run the test methods which compares the map reduce methods when ran through different processes

Macbook Pro M1
```
Runtime of default method :  0.039106
Runtime of threaded method :  0.172097
Runtime of multiprocessing method :  0.124178
```

Interestingly enough when running this on my old machine the default method was the fastest
